                    For one weekend a month, throw caution to the wind
                    and blaze a heroʼs trail in the capital city of Avalon – 
                    a place where all manner of men and mystical beings congregate 
                    in search of adventure, glory, and fun. 
                    Whether honing your magical skills at The Guild of Arcane Lore,
                    laboring in The Armory to craft extraordinary weapons,
                    trading all kinds of wares at the Gold & Glory merchantʼs outpost, 
                    or exploring the far expanses of the world of Midlantia, 
                    your character will be an integral part of our living story.

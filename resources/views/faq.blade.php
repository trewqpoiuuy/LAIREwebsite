                    Coming to a new game for the first time can be very intimidating, so feel free to contact us ahead of time. Our 
                    <a href="mailto:LAIREPR@gmail.com?Subject=My%20First%20Event">PR staff</a> would love to answer any of your questions 
                    before you come to your first event. Our <a href="mailto:lairelogistics@yahoo.com?Subject=My%20First%20Event">logistics staff</a> 
                    would like to hear from you as well, so they can provide you a sleeping assignment.
                    </p>

					<p>
					<b>Arriving:</b> Park in the lower parking lot. The upper parking lot is for staff only. There is a long building next to the upper 
					parking lot commonly called “the inn”. Check in there with the logistics staff so they know you have arrived. The logistics staff will 
					provide your character card, sleeping area assignment, and work shift assignment. Your first event, your work shift will be new player 
					training which is always Friday night. (It is possible to receive new player training during a different time, if you are unable to attend 
					Friday night. Please <a href="mailto:LAIREPR@gmail.com?Subject=My%20First%20Event">contact PR</a> in advance.) 
					</p>

					<p>
					Next you will check in with the finance staff. Your first event is free but they still need to know you have arrived. Finance and 
					logistics check in is usually side-by-side in the inn for your convenience.
					</p>

					<p>
					After checking in, ask around for a member of PR who will introduce you to the new player trainer for that event. They will answer 
					all your questions and tell you where to place your belongings. There will be a brief gathering of all the players called “opening 
					ceremonies” where important announcements will be made. After this you will begin your new player training. 
					</p>

					<p>
					At the end of the event there will be a brief “closing ceremonies” where additional important announcements will be made. After that you will pack up your belongings, help clean up your sleeping area and move your belongings into your car. After you are done with all of that, pay the kitchen and bar if you owe money on a tab. Then, turn in your character card at logistics, along with a silver piece for “upkeep” (feeding, clothing and housing your character during the weeks between events). This is usually located in the barn next to the inn. At some point please check in with our PR staff, or any member of the welcoming committee (who will be wearing the favor pictured below). We would love to know how your first event was!
					</p>

					<p>
					The Welcoming Committee will be wearing a bright yellow favor with an open white book on their belts. They are here to help you have a great time! Feel free to ask them for help, clarifications, or role playing advice at any time during the weekend.
